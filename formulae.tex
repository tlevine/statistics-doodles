These formul\ae\ are for the bivariate (rather than more-than-two) populations (rather than samples).

\section{Covariance}
Conceptually, it's this.
$$ \sigma_{xy} = \operatorname{E}{\big[\left(x - \operatorname{E}[x])(y - \operatorname{E}[y]\right)\big]} $$

More precisely, it could be this.
$$ \sigma_{xy} = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( x_{i}-\bar{x} \right) \left( y_{i}-\bar{y} \right) $$

As matrix arithmetic, it's this.

In R, it's this.

\begin{verbatim}
cov(x,y)
\end{verbatim}

\section{Variance}
Variance is the covariance of something with itself.
$$ \sigma_{x}^2 = \sigma_{xx} = \operatorname{E}{\big[\left(x - \operatorname{E}[x]\right)^2\big]} $$

More precisely, like the covariance, it could be this.
$$ \sigma_{x}^2 = \frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left( x_{i}-\bar{x} \right) \left( x_{i}-\bar{x} \right) $$

\section{Correlation}
\section{Ordinary least-squares regression}
