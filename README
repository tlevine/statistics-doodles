Statistics with doodles
=======================
Here are materials for a talk on statistics with doodles.

Abstract

XXX

Audience
--------
This is mostly intended for people who have taken a conventional
statistics course, but others will probably learn something too.

How to
------

Talk through the introduction slides, then
talk through the doodles slides, falling back
to a whiteboard (or whatever) as needed.

While doing the main doodling, also gradually fill
out the table described below on the whiteboard.
The table has three columns, called "doodle", "stat 100",
and "stat 200". It has four rows, one for each of the
statistics that we are discussing.

Also, point out this cool thing.

    \sigma_{xx} = {\sigma_x}^2

In this table, the doodle is an iconic doodle that reminds
us of the full doodle that we talked through. The stat 100
is the formula for the bivariate version of the statistic
in summation notation. The stat 200 is the formula for the
more-than-two-variate version in matrix notation.

Grand points to make and conclude with
---------------------------------------

1. A statistic is a number that describes a lot of other
    numbers. We use them because we can't fit lots of numbers
    in our brains all at once.
2. Covariance is a statistic that describes the strength of
    linear relationships.
3. Variance is a statistic that describes how spread-out some
    numbers are.
4. Correlation is a standardized version of covariance.
5. (Beta coefficients for) least-squares regression describe
    one variable based on other variables.
6. You can pretty much always draw math.
